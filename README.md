Rice Detection Image Classification using Vision Transformer (ViT)
This repository contains the implementation of an image classification model for rice detection using a Vision Transformer (ViT). The code is developed on Google Colab and utilizes a pre-trained ViT model from Hugging Face. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle.


The goal of this project is to build an efficient image classification model to detect different types of rice using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. ViT leverages the transformer model's capabilities in image classification tasks by treating image patches as sequences, similar to words in NLP tasks.

Dataset
The rice detection dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains multiple categories of rice images, which are used to train and evaluate the model.

Model
The Vision Transformer (ViT) model is used in this project. A pre-trained ViT model from Hugging Face's transformers library is fine-tuned on the rice detection dataset to perform the classification task.
